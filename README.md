# Engineering
Code from Petroleum Engineering Work

main.py:
This was one of the first scripts I worked on to automatically pull data from Snowflake with various automated SQL queries, and perform calculations and transformations on the data to better visualize it in PowerBI. This script saved quite literally hundreds of hours of manual work and/or the alternative of just not using the data.

automated_analysis.py:
This is another sample script written that queried a SQL database and a MongoDB collection to combine data sources for hundreds of wells for drilling engineers to analyze rather than them having to go one well at a time through an application's frontend.
